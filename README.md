For this project, I developed a Pokémon-inspired game called "Profémon" which is centered around the professors of my computer science department. I crafted two classes, Skill and Profemon, complete with corresponding header and source files (.hpp and .cpp). The Skill class encapsulates private member variables for storing skill information and public member functions for accessing and modifying skill attributes. As for the Profemon class, it houses private member variables for various Profémon attributes like name, level, experience, and skills. The class also boasts public member functions for interacting with and manipulating Profémon attributes, such as leveling up and learning skills.

Taking it a step further, I introduced a Trainer class, representing Profémon trainers. This class features a team of three Profémons, a Profédex for storage, and a currently selected Profémon. I implemented functionalities for adding, removing, and managing Profémons in a Trainer's team and Profédex. The project also includes department classes (MLDepartment, SoftwareDepartment, and HardwareDepartment) inheriting from the Trainer class, each specializing in a particular type of Profémon.

In essence, this project showcases my proficiency in implementing object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, to create a sophisticated system simulating Profémon and their trainers.
